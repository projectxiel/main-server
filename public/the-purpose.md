# The Purpose Behind This All

My intentions for this resources page are pretty straightforward and simple. This dedicated space allows me, and potentially others, to share information and ideas relating to programming. Unlike social media platforms, which I find somewhat abhorent, this resources page offers a more structured, and less distracting, way of sharing information.

My journey through various creative fields, and mediums - from aspiring author to visual artist, YouTuber, and designer has culminated in a profound love for creation as a whole, with programming at its core. This page is an extension of that passion, a place where I can express some of my thoughts, experiences, and discoveries when it relates to coding.

While this is part of a larger website that encompasses everything related to my youtube channel, this particular section stands unique to the rest. Here, the focus remains solely on programming and information relating to it.

More importantly, this resources page is not a commercial venture. There are no Google Adsense ads or affiliate links cluttering the space. Instead, it's a pure expression of my interest in programming, free from the distractions of monetization.

Controversial or political topics are intentionally avoided, since my aim is to maintain a positive environment where the sole focus is on programming. These topics often drive the focus away from programming, and tend to be both divisive and inflammatory doing more harm than good.

 This is a place for learning, sharing, and growing together as a community of programmers, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder. Elitism and gatekeeping, are two of the biggest barriers that get put up by the community in my opinion.

That being said, its important to remember that the content residing on this page is often based on my personal experiences and knowledge. It is not professional concrete advice. I encourage readers to approach the resources with a critical mind, doing their own research to validate or challenge the concepts discussed. 

I encourage this regardless of the source of information.

Each article will have an open source Markdown file that can be refined by the community at large. Since it's open source, you can do everything you would normally do: open issues, submit pull requests, and suggest additions or removals.

 The goal of this page is to enlighten, encourage, provide insight, and help people understand complex things in what is hopefully an easier to digest way.
